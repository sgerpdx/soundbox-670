## This repo is a React app built up without a bootstrap

- Dependencies have been installed to the extent that they should be useful for any project elaboration.
- Webpack has been configured, with certain settings such as 'entry' left to default configuration.
- A variety of other files have been added, e.g. .gitignore and .env.
- Basic functionality is present in terms of rendering and snapshot testing.

### Notes on status and intended usage:

* App is functional when served locally, but needs further trials in terms of GitHub CI, etc.
* Ideally this may serve as the basis for a minimalist React bootstrap/template.
